This project showcases the objected oriented features of the Java Object-Oriented Programming Language. 
Through the use of a Binary Search Tree we go through various sorting methods, searches, and traversals to manipulate our tree. 

The program uses several methods to search the tree such as finding specific elements, finding the height, finding the 
smallest, finding the largest and finding the Nth largest element. 

The program Manipulates the tree by deleting a chosen node, and resorting the Tree. 

Finally, various traversals are used for a breadth first search, and a depth first search(in order, post-order, and pre-order)
